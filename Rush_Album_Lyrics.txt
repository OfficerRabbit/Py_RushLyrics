Well, I say as I look back, And all the thoughts Ive had, They reflect just what Im learning. Yes, you know that the hardest part, Yes, I say it is to stay on top, On top of a world forever churning. Well, you say you can laugh, But I can see that your eyes are glass. Well, do you see, cant you see, what Im feeling? Yes, Ive seen your face before. Why, Ive seen it everywhere, Showing up to me without a scent revealing. Well, I said will it ever change? Will it stay the same? Id surely like to know before its over. Well, I said I played some. I said it wont be long, Wont be long before I stop and play it over. Oh, oh Ive, Ive seen your face before. Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again? Oh, oh Ive, Ive been in one place too long. Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?" } , { "song name": "What You"re Doing" , "song lyrics": "Well, I see you standin there with your finger in the air.

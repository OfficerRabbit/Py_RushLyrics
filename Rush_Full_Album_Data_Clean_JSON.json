High above the city square Globes of light float in mid-air Higher still, against the night Clockwork angels bathed in light. You promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise Every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes Clockwork angels, promise every prize. Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands - As if to fly. All around the city square Power shimmers in the air People gazing up with love To those angels high above. Celestial machinery - move through your commands Goddesses of mystery, so delicate and so grand Moved to worship, we bow and close our eyes Clockwork angels, promise every prize. \"Lean not upon your own understanding * Ignorance is well and truly blessed Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning Everything will turn out for the best\".Stars aglow like scattered sparks Span the sky in clockwork arcs Hint at more than we can see Spiritual machinery", "track_length": "7:31", "track_number": "3"}, null, {"track_title": "The Anarchist", "track_lyrics": "WALKING AMONG THE PEOPLE - who are so content, so. blind. - the Anarchist hears the pedlar's call, and sneers derisively. \"What do I lack?

# Project overview

Rush lyrics project. I recently found the site Pudding.Cool that has some really cool data visualizations and stories. After reading their article, <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/">'Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?'</a> and <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction/">'She Giggles, He Gallops'</a>, I wanted to try some lyrics analysis of my own. No better place to start than with my favorite band, Rush.

Of salesmen!!!

# Notes

I initially was using www.AZLyrics.com for the lyrics scraping, but it seems I can no longer access the site. IP ban perhaps? I'll try adding in more time between requests, currently 5 seconds between request.

Currently building a single album, Rush 1974, to do some practice with. Hopefully I'll be able to apply the analysis to the whole data set.
